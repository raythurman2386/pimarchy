# Roadmap & Future Thoughts

Pimarchy is a living project. This page outlines our current goals, planned features, and future ideas for the Raspberry Pi 5 desktop transformation.

## Phase 1: Core Stability (Current)
- [x] **Automated Installer:** Provisioning Pi OS Lite to Hyprland.
- [x] **Ravenwood Theme:** Centralized variables and templates.
- [x] **Backup System:** Safe and reversible installations.
- [x] **Core Components:** Hyprland, Waybar, Rofi, Mako, Alacritty.

## Phase 2: User Experience (Next)
- [ ] **Quick Theme Switcher:** A script to switch between predefined color palettes (e.g., Gruvbox, Nord, Catppuccin) without a full re-install.
- [ ] **GUI Configurator:** A simple terminal UI (`whiptail` or `gum`) for modifying `theme.conf` variables.
- [ ] **Lock Screen Enhancement:** Integrating `swaylock-effects` for blurred background and custom layout.
- [ ] **Bluetooth Support:** Built-in menu or shortcut for managing Bluetooth connections on the Pi 5.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Planned)
- [ ] **Pimarchy-Hub:** A light dashboard or menu for managing system performance, Docker containers, and OpenCode tasks.
- [ ] **Extension Support:** A structured way for users to add and share "Pimarchy Modules."
- [ ] **Official Support for Pi 4:** Exploring compatibility and performance for the previous generation.

## Future Ideas & Brainstorming
- **Game Mode:** A one-click configuration for maximizing gaming performance (e.g., stopping non-essential services, max GPU clock).
- **Home Server Mode:** A module to quickly deploy Pi-hole, Home Assistant, and a media server alongside the desktop.
- **Pi 500 Specific Optimizations:** Tailoring the desktop experience specifically for the Pi 500 keyboard form factor.
